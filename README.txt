Boston Public School Data Wrangling
March 2018

Overview:
I compiled four datasets into a single sheet for analysis. My goal was to 
gather information on individual schools over a multi-year time period to
make planning a recruiting trip for college, corporate, and military
recruiters easier. This included data on Graduation Plans, SAT scores,
disciplinary actions, and basic contact and location information.
